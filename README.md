This repository is a test toolbox for Scilab. It requires "thirdparty" directory which can be downloaded from the page: https://scilab.in/fossee-scilab-toolbox. The "thirdparty" directory contains compiled library for a simple "multiplication" function written in C. After copying the "thirdparty" directory to the toolbox directory, on the scilab console run "exec builder.sce" to build the toolbox and then run "exec loader.sce" to load the toolbox. The libraries are built on a Linux OS. Type "help" in the scilab console and browse through the help content of "test_toolbox".
This toolbox overall demonstrates
1. How to add a function defined in C in scilab
2. How to add a function defined in Scilab in Scilab
3. How to write help for the added functions
4. How to create a toolbox out of the above functions.
